# Predicting stone artefact classification: A case study from the Ban Rai Area, Thailand
Laura Vodden

Stone artefacts comprise a large proportion of objects recovered from archaeological sites,
owing to their durability and resistance to deterioration (Clarkson and O’Connor, 2007).
They are valuable to archaeologists, because they provide an excellent record of human
behaviour throughout prehistory, and can reveal information about diet, creativity, and past
human interactions with the environment (Clarkson and O’Connor, 2007; Marwick, 2008).
The purpose of this report is to investigate whether machine learning algorithms can use
archaeological data to classify a stone artefact assemblage into two broad categories. The
report makes use of observational data relating to artefacts excavated from a rock shelter at
Ban Rai, Northwest Thailand, between 2001 and 2007.
In performing the investigation, three machine learning algorithms were applied to the data:
A Naïve-Bayes Classifier first assessed the accuracy of predictions, a Logistic Regression then
assessed the variables most likely to affect classification either way, and a K-Means Cluster
Analysis was used to visualise the data, to see if the parameters for each artefact category
were distinct enough to form two clusters.
The report finds that machine learning algorithms can be used to classify the Ban Rai stone
artefacts into two categories. This has implications for archaeological investigation, because
it suggests that machine learning algorithms can be applied to other archaeological
assemblages, and perhaps can even further differentiate between sub-categories of
artefacts, leading to new and exciting discoveries.
